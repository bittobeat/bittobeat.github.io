As follows, the human beings making Bit To Beat are...

### **Michael Berger**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Michael Berger is the team lead of From Nothing and is
acting as primary game designer for the project. He fits the role naturally, as
he can focus intensely on smaller details and take into account the bigger
picture. He has also dedicated himself to audio implementation, making sure all
of the musical programming wizardry is guaranteed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with having an analytical mind, Michael is a
long-time fan of rhythm games and has worked on various rhythm game related
passion projects. He does his best to play every week, to make sure those years
of muscle memory don’t fade away. Outside of rhythm games, Michael enjoys a good
platformer, and he occasionally indulges in the sin that is watching anime.

### **Jiayan "William" Li**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William is the primary programmer of From Nothing,
making sure the underlying game systems are solid and doing all that they need
to do. Alongside his programming responsibilities, William is a skilled
technical artist and is dedicated to making basic art assets look as stylized
and unique as possible.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from his technical mastery, William heavily enjoys
the Monster Hunter series. Other recent addictions include Hideo Kojima’s Death
Stranding and the multiplayer battle arena Heroes of the Storm.

#### **Will Bertiz**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will is the composer for From Nothing, making music for
the team and all their rhythm-based needs. As a lover of music and games from a
young age, Will is very passionate about game audio and all the intricacies that
come along with it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of games, Will’s favorite games include those
from the Persona and Fire Emblem series. He’s also poured an ungodly amount of
hours into Stardew Valley and Factorio in a disturbingly short amount of time.
